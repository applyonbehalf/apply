## 🔄 Current Workflow

### **For Regular Users:**
1. Register/Login → Create Profile → Add Job URLs → Monitor Progress

### **For Admins:**
1. Add job categories → Upload URLs in bulk → Monitor system performance

### **Bot Processing:**
1. Queue Management → Form Analysis → AI Decision Making → Submission → Status Updates

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **Core Tables:**
- `users` - User accounts and subscription info
- `user_profiles` - Multiple profiles per user with job preferences
- `job_categories` - Admin-managed job categories
- `job_urls` - Available job listings by category
- `job_applications` - User application requests and status
- `captcha_sessions` - CAPTCHA handling workflow
- `notifications` - System alerts and updates

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI server
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: Web dashboard (planned)
- **Bot**: Selenium-based automation
- **AI**: Google Gemini integration

🎯 What We've Achieved
Your output shows:

✅ Admin API is working - You can manage job categories
✅ Database is properly structured - 6 job categories created
✅ URL management works - Successfully added URLs to cyber security category
✅ Authentication works - Admin privileges confirmed

🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)
Phase 1: Complete the Processing Pipeline

# 🚀 IntelliApply Next Steps Guide

## 🎯 Phase 1: Complete Processing Pipeline (Next 2-3 Days)

### **Step 1: Test End-to-End Application Processing**
```bash
# 1. Start the enhanced bot system
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002 --reload

# 2. Test the complete workflow
python test_enhanced_bot.py
```

**What this tests:**
- User registration/login
- Profile creation
- Adding job URLs to queue
- Bot processing applications
- CAPTCHA handling
- Success/failure tracking

### **Step 2: Add Real Job URLs**
```bash
# Add real cybersecurity job URLs
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/api/admin/job-urls" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "category_id": "d7c97b20-402c-4870-9686-64b1d9438597",
       "urls": [
         "https://jobs.lever.co/example/security-analyst",
         "https://boards.greenhouse.io/example/jobs/security-engineer",
         "https://company.com/careers/cybersecurity-specialist"
       ]
     }'
```

### **Step 3: Test Real Application Processing**
1. Create a regular user account (not admin)
